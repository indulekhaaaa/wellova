### Project Overview  
Wellova is a dedicated website designed to assist individuals diagnosed with PCOS/PCOD. It empowers users to track their symptoms and make informed lifestyle decisions, ultimately helping them lead healthier lives.

---

### The Problem 
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) are reproductive disorders that significantly affect physical and mental health. Symptoms include hormonal imbalances, fertility issues, acne, weight gain, and mood swings. 

Despite the increasing diagnosis rates, there are limited platforms that comprehensively support symptom tracking and lifestyle management for PCOS/PCOD patients. Most existing apps offer only generalized features that fail to address the disorder's full spectrum.

### The Solution  
Wellova is specifically designed to help PCOS/PCOD patients effectively manage their symptoms. Key features include:  
- Symptom Tracking: Allows users to log symptoms, monitor patterns, and observe progress over time.  
- Lifestyle Management: Offers tools and recommendations for maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle.  
- User-Friendly Interface: The simple design ensures daily use and encourages consistent tracking.  

Wellova aims to provide structure and predictability, enabling users to live life to the fullest.
